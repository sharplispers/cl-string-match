  ;; At the first step, S[1..m]$ is inserted in an empty tree and suffix tree T1 is composed of
  ;; a unique node. At step i + 1, suffix S[i + 1..m]$ is inserted in Ti as follows. Traverse the tree
  ;; starting at the root r and find the longest prefix that matches a path of Ti . If such prefix is
  ;; not found, this is because none of the previous suffixes S[j..m]$, for j = 1 to j = i, starts
  ;; by character S[i + 1]. In this case, a new leaf numbered i + 1 with edge-label S[i + 1..m]$ is
  ;; created and joined to the root.

  ;; Thus, assume there is a path such that S[i + 1..m]$ is a prefix of maximal length of
  ;; that path. Because of the presence of the termination character $, the prefix cannot be a
  ;; substring of a suffix entered into the tree early on. Therefore, there is a character at position
  ;; k such that S[i + 1..k]$ is the prefix; let S[k..m]$ be the non-matching substring. Let (u, v)
  ;; be the edge of the path where character S[k] is found. The algorithm creates a new node w
  ;; and a leaf numbered i + 1. Node w splits edge (u, v) into edges (u, w) and (w, v), and edge
  ;; joining w and leaf i + 1 receives edge-label S[i + 1..k]$. The algorithm finishes when the
