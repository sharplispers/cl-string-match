	* src/aho-corasick.lisp was not implementing fail transitions of
	the Aho-Corasick algorithm. While adding its implementation the
	Trie building code got unique node ids, and we are now using ITER
	in some places.

	* src/boyer-moore.lisp now implements the Boyer-Moore algorithm
	similar to the one described by Christian Charras and Thierry
	Lecroq. Unlike a lot of other implementations this uses bad char
	AND good suffix shift tables: important for Commentz-Walter
	algorithm implementation.

	* src/boyer-moore.lisp had the Boyer-Moore-Horspool algorithm
	implemented, not the Boyer-Moore as declared in the comments,
	README, and everywhere else. This was discovered while working on
	the implementation of the Commentz-Walter algorithm.
